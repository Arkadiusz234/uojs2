# uojs2

An online client for the popular game Ultima Online. PLEASE submit a PR if you would like to contribute!!! I could definitely use help maintaining a non-shitty codebase.

## What this is:

It's going to be a working version of my original client, uojs. My goal is to have a cleaner and more modular codebase than my last project. 

I'm looking into using Redux to manage the state.

## Current Status

I barely have networking working (as of 2016-06-10). It uses websockify to proxy the websocket into a tcp socket. Once I get that working well, I'll start on adding an interface. :+1:
